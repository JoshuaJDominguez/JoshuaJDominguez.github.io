    <p>Common Questions:</p>

<p>What is linux?</p>
<p> Contents Linux is the best-known and most-used open source operating system. As an operating system, Linux is software that sits underneath all of the other software on a computer, receiving requests from those programs and relaying these requests to the computer's hardware.</p>
<hr>
<p>Why should I learn linux?</p>
<p>Learning Linux opens up a whole new world of possibility in the tech world! Different variations and forms of it exist in several OP systems such as MacOS, Windows, Dell, and Dozens more. Learning linux gives you the power to control and maintain all of the previously listed systems, this is how hackers infiltrate and take from databases (which I do not recommend), and also how you can express creativity by getting command lines in games to do fun things such as flying in Elden Ring!</p>
<hr>
<p>Do hackers use linux?</p>
<p>Yes, and many other OP systems</p>
<hr>
<p>Is linux difficult to learn?</p>
<p>Anything worth learning is hard, if it was easy everyone would do it.</p>
